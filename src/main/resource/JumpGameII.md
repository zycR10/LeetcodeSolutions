# JumpGameII

## 题目 
Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
给一个正整数数组，假设你的初始位置是数组中的第一位，数组中的每个元素代表了你当前所能跳跃的最大值，你的目标是用最少的跳跃次数跳到数组的最后一位

Example:

Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
    Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
Note:

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
